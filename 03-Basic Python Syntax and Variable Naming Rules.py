#     VARIABLE NAMING RULES

#Variable names cannot contain spaces or operator symbols except for the _(underscore) character. Also, variable names cannot start with a number.
#Variable names cannot be made from keywords.
#(if, for while, else, def, in, is) keywords

#Do not use long variable names! At most, use 3 words.


#Use meaningful variable names to understand what they are used for.
yas = 45


# In Python, you can use characters from other languages for variable naming. However, it is recommended to use English words for code readability.

# Python is case sensitive. Variables count and Count are not the same.
