#Problem: Calculate and display the area of a circle with a given radius.

#To solve this problem, we will break it down into smaller parts, such as input, processing, and output.

#Algorithm:

#1. Create a variable to store the input (radius).
#2. Calculate the area of the circle using the formula A = πr^2, where π is approximately equal to 3.14.
#3. Display the result on the screen.

#Example Code:

radius = float(input("Please enter the radius: "))
area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
print("The area of the circle is: ", area)

#Problem: Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

#Algorithm:

#1. Get input from the user for the length and width of the rectangle.
#2. Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the formulas:

area = length * width, perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
#3. Display the area and perimeter values on the screen.

#Example Code:

length = float(input("Please enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Please enter the width of the rectangle: "))

area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

print("The area of the rectangle is: ", area)
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is: ", perimeter)
